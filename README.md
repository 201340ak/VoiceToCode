# Voice To Code

The goal of this application is provide a flexible, customizable, easy to use application to code using your voice.

## Tech Stack

- [ElectronJS](https://electronjs.org/) for the application client.
- [Artyom.js](https://sdkcarlos.github.io/sites/artyom.html) for the speech tools.
- [Robotjs](http://robotjs.io/) for more control over mouse and keyboard.

## Notes

This project is in early (and I mean EARLY) versions.
Status: Learning more about robot and artyom, trying to build up more complex commands.
